# API Documentation

This document provides a brief overview of various concepts related to APIs, including what they are, REST APIs, microservices, CSV and JSON formats, and Pythonic naming conventions.

## Key Concepts

### What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It enables different software components to communicate with each other.

### What is a REST API?
A REST API uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources identified by URIs. It is stateless, meaning each request must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

### What are Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with others through lightweight mechanisms.

### What is the CSV Format?
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is a simple file format used to store tabular data. Each line of the file is a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.

### What is the JSON Format?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language.

## Pythonic Naming Conventions

### Package and Module Names
Package and module names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores (`my_package`, `my_module`).

### Class Names
Class names should use CapWords (`MyClass`).

### Variable Names
Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores (`my_variable`).

### Function Names
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores (`my_function`).

### Constant Names
Constant names should be uppercase, with words separated by underscores (`MY_CONSTANT`).
