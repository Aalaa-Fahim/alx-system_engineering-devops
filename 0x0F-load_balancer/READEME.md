## Overview

This repository contains documentation and setup instructions for a load balancer. A load balancer distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. This increases responsiveness and availability of applications.

## Features

- **Traffic Distribution**: Efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
- **High Availability**: Increases the reliability of applications by reducing the risk of overload.
- **Scalability**: Allows for easy scaling of applications by adding or removing servers as needed.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Software**: Ensure you have the necessary software installed on your server(s). This may include operating system packages for load balancing and networking tools.

2. **Configure Load Balancer**: Use the configuration files provided in this repository to set up your load balancer. This typically involves specifying the servers to distribute traffic to and setting up health checks to ensure servers are operational.

3. **Start Load Balancer**: Start the load balancer service according to your operating system's procedures. This usually involves running a command like `service load_balancer start`.

4. **Test Configuration**: Verify that the load balancer is correctly distributing traffic among your servers. You can do this by sending requests to the load balancer's IP address and observing the responses.
